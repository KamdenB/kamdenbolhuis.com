            <p>&Tab;I first became interested in programming in 2014 at the age of 11. I started off with simple Lego Mindstorms programming, and gradually progressed on to Java, and later on web development in 2016 where I took a class at BizStream called BizStream academy, and then later in the year a private study mentorship for 8 months.</p>

        <p>Throughout the 2018/2019 school year I developed a signature app which would be used to collect client signatures, upload them to google drive, and then insert them into a specific google sheet document. This app was built using the Ionic framework.</p>

        <p class="job-desc text-secondary">Full stack web development</p>
        <p>11 Years ago I started playing homeschool soccer, and over the years the orgranization folded, at which point my mom took it over and has been organizing it for 8 years now. In 2019 we decided to make the switch to online registration. With my passion for web development, I figured I may as well make a totally custom registration system. I was really intreest in in NodeJS/Express web development, so I figured this would be a great oppertunity to learn it. It was a great oppertunity to write a functional website that would be heavily used and I learned a lot in the process.</p>
