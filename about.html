              I first became interested in programming in 2014 when I was just 11. I started off with simple Lego Mindstorms programming, and gradually progressed on to Java, and later on to Web Development. It was in 2016 when I took a class at BizStream Academy that I knew I was hooked. I had the opportunity to stay on at BizStream for a private study mentorship for 8 months where I grew my ability even more. Since that time at BizStream, I have continued to progress my skills.
              I have decided that I am definitely interested in a career in Web Development.

        <h3>Logicraft Industrial Systems</h3>
        <p class="job-desc text-secondary">Freelance Android App Developer</p>
        <p>Throughout the 2018/2019 school year I was hired to develop a signature app. During the development process, I learned a lot about managing changing client expectations and scope creep. The completed project was an app used to collect client signatures, upload them to google drive, and then insert them into a specific google sheet document. This app was built using the Ionic framework and custom GScripts to manage where the signature was put.</p>

        <p class="job-desc text-secondary">Full stack web development</p>
        <p>I have been playing homeschool soccer for eleven years. Thanks to my passion for web development, I was hired to make a totally custom online registration system to replace the antiquated mail in registration system. I was really interested in NodeJS/Express web development, so I knew this would be a good opportunity to learn it. It has been a great opportunity to write a functional website that would be heavily used. I learned a lot in the process and I made the registration system smooth and easy for the users.</p>
