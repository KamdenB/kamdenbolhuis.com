            <p>&Tab;I first became interested in programming in 2014 at the age of 11. I started off with simple Lego Mindstorms programming, and gradually progressed on to Java, and later on web development in 2016 where I took a class at BizStream called BizStream academy, and then later in the year a private study mentorship for 8 months.&NewLine;
            Since then I've continued to progress my skills, and I've really learned that I like making website more functional than look good, databases, apis, etc, I love being able to pull external data and using it such a way that it adds more functionality to the website.

        <p>Throughout the 2018/2019 school year I was hired to develop a signature app which would be used to collect client signatures, upload them to google drive, and then insert them into a specific google sheet document. This app was built using the Ionic framework.</p>

        <p class="job-desc text-secondary">Full stack web development</p>
        <p>I have been playing homeschool soccer for eleven years. Thanks to my passion for web development, I was hired to make a totally custom online registration system to replace the antiquated mail in registration system. I was really interested in NodeJS/Express web development, so I knew this would be a good opportunity to learn it. It has been a great opportunity to write a functional website that would be heavily used. I learned at lot in the process and I made the registration system smooth and easy to use for users.</p>
